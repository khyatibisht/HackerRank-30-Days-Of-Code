		<p><strong>Marie Curie,</strong> was a pioneering physicist and chemist, who won a Nobel Peace Prize twice (1903, 1911) for her work on radioactivity. At this time, she is one of only a handful of distinguished scientists to have won two Nobel Prizes remains the only woman to have done so and was part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was also the first woman to hold Ph.D degree at a French University at that time.</p><p> Her achievements and the recognition of her work are exceedingly impressive feats considering that she lived at a time in history when women were largely excluded from higher education. She was made professor at the University of Paris - the first woman to have achieved the honour - and used her knowledge to develop mobile radiography units which were used to treat wounded French soldiers on the battlefields of World War I.</p><p> While a French citizen, Marie Skłodowska Curie (she used both surnames) never lost her sense of Polish identity. She taught her daughters the Polish language and took them on visits to Poland. She named the first chemical element that she discovered—polonium, which she isolated in 1898—after her native country. In 1920, Curie together with Claudius Regaud, founded the Curie Institute in Paris which utilised Curie's knowledge of radioactivity for the treatment of cancer, alongside surgical procedures.</p><p> Concerned more with humanitarian causes than financial rewards, Marie Curie was one of the most celebrated scientists of her time, at a time when the field was almost exclusively for men.</p>

		<h3>Unknown Facts <br/></h3>

        <br/>
				<p>• &nbsp	Marie Curie was originally ignored by the Nobel Prize Nominating Committee <br/>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 1903, members of the French Academy of Sciences wrote a letter to the Swedish Academy in which they nominated the collective discoveries in the field of radioactivity made by Marie and Pierre Curie, as well as their contemporary Henri Becquerel, for the Nobel Prize in Physics. Yet, in a sign of the times and its prevailing sexist attitudes, no recognition of Marie’s contributions was offered, nor was there even any mention of her name. Thankfully, a sympathetic member of the nominating committee, a professor of mathematics at Stockholm University College named Gösta Mittage-Leffler, wrote a letter to Pierre warning him of the glaring omission. Pierre, in turn, wrote the committee insisting that he and Marie be “considered together with respect to our research on radioactive bodies.”
Eventually, the wording of the official nomination was amended. Later that year, thanks to a combination of her accomplishments and the combined efforts of her husband and Mittage-Leffler, Marie Curie became the first woman in history to receive the Nobel Prize.
</p><br>
				<p>• &nbsp	She refused to cash in on her discoveries <br/>
   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
After discovering Radium in 1898, Marie and Pierre balked at the opportunity to pursue a patent for it and to profit from its production, despite the fact that they had barely enough money to procure the uranium slag they needed in order to extract the element. To the contrary, the Curies generously shared the isolated product of Marie's difficult labors with fellow researchers and openly distributed the secrets of the process needed for its production with interested industrial parties.
</p> <br>
        
        <p>• &nbsp	Her first daughter, Irene, won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her work with Aluminum and radiation.</p> <br>
        
         <p>• &nbsp	Einstein encouraged Marie Curie during one of the worst years of her life <br/> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Albert Einstein and Marie Curie first met in Brussels at the prestigious Solvay Conference in 1911. By this time, France had reached the peak of its rising sexism, xenophobia, and anti-semitism that defined the years preceding the First World War. Curie’s nomination to the French Academy of Sciences was rejected, and many suspected that biases against her gender and immigrant roots were to blame. Furthermore, it came to light that she had been involved in a romantic relationship with her married colleague, Paul Langevin, though he was estranged from his wife at the time. Though she had just been awarded a second Nobel Prize, the nominating committee now sought to discourage Curie from traveling to Stockholm to accept it so as to avoid a scandal. Marie Curie sank into a deep depression and retreated from the public eye.
Around this time, Curie received a letter from Albert Einstein in which he described his admiration for her, as well as offered his heart-felt advice on how to handle the events as they unfolded. “I am impelled to tell you how much I have come to admire your intellect, your drive, and your honesty,” he wrote, “and that I consider myself lucky to have made your personal acquaintance...” As for the frenzy of newspaper articles attacking her, Einstein encouraged Curie “to simply not read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated.”
</p> <br>
        
         <p>• &nbsp	Marie’s second daughter Ève Curie wrote the first of many biographies devoted to her famous mother, Madame Curie in 1937, which became a feature film a few years later.</p> <br>
